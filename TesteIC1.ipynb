Check if the graph is planar using a planarity testing algorithm (e.g., Boyer-Myrvold Planarity Test).\\n3. If the graph is planar, find an embedding of the graph in the plane such that no two edges intersect.\\n4. For each edge, check if it intersects with the Silver ring. If it does, mark it as \"outside\" (o), otherwise mark it as \"inside\" (i).\\n5.
